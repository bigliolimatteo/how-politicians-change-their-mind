# how-politicians-change-their-mind

In these past years we experienced a boost in the use of social media platforms by politicians, which moved from not even being present to posting multiple times a day following accurate marketing strategies.

In this project we will analyse tweets from Italian politicians and cluster them into topics using different techniques.

The anticipation would be to find cluster of tweets addressing immigration, justice, taxes, retirements benefits, etc...

We will discuss our findings by comparing different politicians based on the topics addressed in their social communication strategy.

We will also compare the cluster distribution obtained from the different embeddings.
